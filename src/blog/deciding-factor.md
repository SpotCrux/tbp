According to studies, an average person makes at least 33,000 to 35,000 decisions per day. The sheer number is staggering and mind-boggling when you really think about it. It’s probably true too—considering that the moment we open our eyes, we’re immediately faced with choices: Should we get up or continue sleeping? If we choose to get up, we must make another decision: What to do next—shower or have breakfast?

Every decision we make sets off a cascade of subsequent choices, each one waiting for our next move. But this isn't the only point I want to emphasize. Let’s also reflect on how we make these decisions and what factors influence them. Is it our mood, our past experiences, or the people around us? How do we navigate this labyrinth of choices every single day?

Our choices not only shape our day but also paint the broader canvas of our lives. So, let's dive deeper into the decision-making process and uncover the hidden factors that drive our choices. Every decision, no matter how small, contributes to the grand tapestry of our existence. Isn’t that fascinating?

# How to be a right decision-maker?

<br>

## 1. Don't decide by your emotions.

<br>

As the Bible said, **"fools are those who pulled by their emotions"**. 
Only a fool makes decisions based on their emotions. Is it true? Why?
Because emotions can sometimes cloud judgment and lead to irrational choices. The more we rely on it, the more we chance to get hurt, or make bad decisions and the worst case scenario, "we will pulled it towards evil." While emotions are a vital part of our human experience, relying exclusively on them can sometimes lead to regrettable outcomes.

As the famous quote says, 
"*If the emotion is high, intelligence is Low.*".
 We cannot really trust our emotions as well as our hearts. Cause even the Bible tells about it.

> “The heart is deceitful above all things,
   And desperately wicked; 
   Who can know it?" <br>
Jeremiah 17:9

The Bible provides us with a profound warning about the heart. It tells us that when making decisions, we should be wary of asking our heart to lead the way. The reason for this caution is profound: the heart can make us blind to reality. It is described as deceitful and desperately wicked, concerned only with its own desires.

Consider this analogy: our heart is like a trickster. It will say, "As long as you're happy, then it's alright. Don't worry about anything else. It doesnt matter if you suffer tomorrow, the next day, the month or the next year. All that matter is, You are happy right now. If will makes you suffer in the future, just deal with it then. But for now, as long as you are happy, then everything is right."
